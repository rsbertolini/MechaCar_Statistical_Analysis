## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle weight, ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model as seen in the summary snapshot below.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the line should not be zero.  The p-value is very small and lower than .05 indicating there is some correlation between variables.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, the R-squared value is .71 which indicates over 70% of predictions will be correct.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
